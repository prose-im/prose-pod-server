# To do

- Integration tests
  - When tests are ran, write somewhere the commit hash of Prosody and the
    community modules at which tests passed, and mention it in the changelog.
    Maybe the changelog can even be the single place where it’s written.
    We should figure that out.
- Configure Clippy
  - Enable [`missing_inline_in_public_items`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/stable/index.html#missing_inline_in_public_items)
