summary: 'Support for push notification filtering rules'
...

Introduction
============

This module implements support for a group of [push notification extensions](https://xeps.tigase.net//docs/push-notifications/filters)
by the Tigase team that allow a client to specify filters to be applied to
push notifications.

It is a custom extension to [XEP-0357: Push Notifications](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0357.html).

It is planned that this will evolve to a XEP in the near future.

Details
=======

Add to modules_enabled, there are no configuration options.

Compatibility
=============

Not tested, but hopefully works on 0.11.x and later.
