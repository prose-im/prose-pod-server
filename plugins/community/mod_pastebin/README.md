summary: Redirect long messages to built-in pastebin
---

# Introduction

Pastebins are used very often in IM, especially in chat rooms. You have
a long log or command output which you need to send to someone over IM,
and don't want to fill their message window with it. Put it on a
pastebin site, and give them the URL instead, simple.

Not for everyone... no matter how hard you try, people will be unaware,
or not care. They may also be too lazy to visit a pastebin. This is
where mod_pastebin comes in!

# Details

When someone posts to a room a "large" (the actual limit is
configurable) message, Prosody will intercept the message and convert it
to a URL pointing to a built-in pastebin server. The URLs are randomly
generated, so they can be considered for most purposes to be private,
and cannot be discovered by people who are not in the room.

**Note:** mod_pastebin cannot read, and therefore does not act on, end-to-end
encrypted messages (e.g. messages using OMEMO).

# Usage

To set up mod_pastebin for MUC rooms it **must** be explicitly loaded,
as in the example below - it won't work when loaded globally, as that
will only load it onto normal virtual hosts.

For example:

    Component "conference.example.com" "muc"
        modules_enabled = { "pastebin" }

Pastes will be available by default at
`http://<your-prosody>:5280/pastebin/` by default.

Ports and path can be changed with [HTTP
settings](https://prosody.im/doc/http), for example like:

``` {.lua}
  http_paths = {
    pastebin = "/$host-paste";
  }
```

# Discovery

The line and character tresholds are advertised in
[service discovery][xep-0030] like this:

``` {.xml}
<iq id="791d37e8-86d8-45df-adc2-9bcb17c45cb7" type="result" xml:lang="en" from="prosody@conference.prosody.im">

    <feature var="http://jabber.org/protocol/muc"/>
    <feature var="https://modules.prosody.im/mod_pastebin"/>
    <x xmlns="jabber:x:data" type="result">

        <value>1584</value>
      </field>
    </x>
  </query>
</iq>
```
