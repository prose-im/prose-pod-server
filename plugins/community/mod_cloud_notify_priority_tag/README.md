Introduction
============

This module implements support for a Tigase XMPP extension, [Priority of notifications](https://xeps.tigase.net//docs/push-notifications/priority/).
It is a custom extension to [XEP-0357: Push Notifications](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0357.html).

It is planned that this will evolve to a XEP in the near future.
